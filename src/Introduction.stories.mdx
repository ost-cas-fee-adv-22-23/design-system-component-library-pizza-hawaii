# Pizza Hawaii Component Library

## 🍕 Welcome to the Pizza Hawaii Design System!

Here, you will find a variety of components that will help you create beautiful, accessible and tasty designs for your websites and apps.

Our components are organized into three categories - **Atoms**, **Molecules**, and **Organisms**. Atoms are the smallest and most basic building blocks, such as text and icons. Molecules are larger and more complex, made up of several atoms. Finally, organisms are the largest and most complete, combining molecules and atoms to create functional sections of a user interface.

In this storybook, you will find a wide range of atoms to choose from. There are headlines in different sizes and styles, icons to add personality and flair, and links to connect your users to different pages and sections. We also have buttons, inputs, and other basic elements to help you build the foundations of your design.

With the Pizza Hawaii Design System, you have everything you need to create delicious and inviting user experiences. So let's get started and build something tasty!

## 🍕 Install

Our components are written in React, Typescript and styled with TailwindCSS.

Add the components to your project.

`npm install --save @smartive-education/pizza-hawaii`

### **Use**

Start building your application with the components and styles provided by the Pizza Hawaii library.

1. Import Components `import { Headline, Icon, ImageOverlay } from '@smartive-education/pizza-hawaii'`
2. Import CSS `import '@smartive-education/pizza-hawaii/dist/bundle.css'`
3. Install Font Poppins `npm install @fontsource/poppins`
4. Import Font into your template

```
import "@fontsource/poppins/500.css";
import "@fontsource/poppins/600.css";
import "@fontsource/poppins/700.css";
```

Now you can use them like this:

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button size="L" colorScheme="gradient" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
      <Icon name="edit"/>
    </div>
  )
```

> Enjoy our components! 🎉
